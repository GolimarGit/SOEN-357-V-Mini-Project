        <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
        <p>
            User testing sessions will allow for the prototype to reflect on
            real use cases. The usability test should focus on the placement of
            components, the ease of use, and feature availability within the
            application. It should identify weaknesses in the current UI and
            offer improvements to enhance the UX.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants representing the personas' background will perform
            given tasks covering the core functionalities of the application:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Registration and Profile Setup</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an account and set basic preferences</li>
                <li>Add a dependent to the profile</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Profile Management</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Update personal information</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Appointment Booking and Management</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Select a doctor</li>
                <li>
                    Book an appointment for themselves and another for their
                    dependent
                </li>
                <li>Reschedule or cancel an appointment</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Medication Reminder Setup</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a medication</li>
                <li>Log a missed or taken dose</li>
                <li>Delete a medication reminder</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Data collection will involve participant feedback through
            think-aloud protocol and a post-test interview, where the
            participant will provide feedback on the usability and their
            satisfaction, and will involve tests where observers must analyze
            metrics such as:

            <ul>
                <li>Task completion rate</li>
                <li>Execution time</li>
                <li>Errors made</li>
                <li>Heatmap and interaction tracking</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the post-test interview has been recorded, the data will be
            categorized into usability issues and ranked by severity, which will
            then be mapped to the user journey. Enhancements will then be
            focused on improving the core functionalities of:

            <ul>
                <li>profile and dependent management</li>
                <li>appointment booking process</li>
                <li>medication reminder interactions</li>
            </ul>

            as well as including additional features suggested by the
            participants during the post-test analysis.
