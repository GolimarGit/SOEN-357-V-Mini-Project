            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The first step for designing a user interface (UI) for any
                software is user research. The data gathered will be used to
                identify user goals and frustrations related to software usage.
                For conveniency, the method for collecting data will be through
                a survey. Participants will be handed slips of paper with
                questions related to their experience with doctor visits via
                booking appointments through online booking systems or via
                walk-in. To make sure that answers are representative of the
                targeted demographic, the survey was handed out at 2 health
                clinics that both offer walk-in and by-booking appointments.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The survey is designed to guide the user through questions that
                follow a logical flow: demographic questions, their current
                appointment process, their willingness to use a mobile app, and
                desired features for a healthcare app. Starting from general
                questions to user suggestions on the applications will make the
                user feel less pressured when answering questions. To maintain
                anonymity, no sensitive information pertaining to their identity
                (name, phone number, etc.) was included in the survey.

                    From the survey, a table containing the answers of 20
                    respondents was made. For readability, the table was
                    separated into its corresponding sections.

            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The personas were created based on the responses collected in
                the survey, ensuring they reflect the needs, preferences, and
                concerns of potential users of the health app. The data shows
                that phone calls are the most common booking method, long wait
                times and scheduling difficulties are major pain points, and
                many users value friendly staff and clear communication.
                Additionally, a significant number of respondents prefer
                manually selecting their doctor, and privacy concerns are a
                common barrier to app adoption. These insights shaped the
                personas by aligning their goals, motivations, and challenges
                with real user responses, ensuring the app design caters to the
                actual needs of its intended audience.
