            The UX design process played a crucial role in identifying user
            needs and improving the product. By conducting a survey and creating
            detailed personas, we gained insights into how different users
            interact with healthcare applications. The personas—Emily, a busy
            professional; Robert, a frequent patient; and Margaret, a
            caregiver—helped shape the app's features to address their specific
            pain points and motivations.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The user journey map further clarified how users navigate through
            the app, from discovering it to booking appointments and managing
            medications. By aligning the design with real user behaviors, we
            ensured that the app would be intuitive and accessible. The
            usability testing process provided valuable feedback on component
            placement, ease of use, and feature availability, leading to
            refinements in navigation and layout.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            One of the key challenges was balancing the needs of different user
            groups. For instance, professionals like Emily required a fast and
            seamless booking experience, while caregivers like Margaret needed
            family scheduling and reminders. Ensuring accessibility, especially
            for elderly users, was another challenge. To address this, we tested
            different UI variations and adjusted text sizes, button placements,
            and interaction flows. Iterative testing helped refine these
            elements, ensuring that the app remained user-friendly across all
            demographics.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Overall, the UX design process allowed us to take a user-centered
            approach, validating design decisions through research and testing.
            By continuously refining the interface based on feedback, we created
            a product that meets diverse healthcare needs while maintaining
            simplicity and efficiency.
