            This healthcare app user journey map illustrates how users navigate
            appointment scheduling and medication management.
            <br>
            Emily likely experiences the journey with efficiency in
            mind - starting skeptical during discovery but feeling relieved
            post-appointment as the app saves her valuable time with quick
            booking and real-time wait updates.
            <br>
            Robert, managing a chronic condition, would particularly value the
            appointment booking and post-appointment phases, where medication
            reminders and follow-up scheduling address his need for continuity
            of care.
            <br>
            Margaret benefits from the simplified medical terminology and family
            medication management opportunities, helping her coordinate care for
            multiple family members with less anxiety.
