            <p>
                User research is a critical step in the UX design process. It involves understanding the needs,
                behaviors, and pain points of the target audience.

            <h3>Persona Creation</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the research findings, we created three primary user personas. Each persona represents a
                distinct segment of our target audience and includes details about their goals, motivations, and pain
                points.
